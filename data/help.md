# Diary
---
### Android personal diary.

* Entries saved in plain text files
* Browse entries
* English, Catalan, Spanish, Japanese and German
* Choice of date picker calendars
* Diary entries may use markdown formatting

## Toolbar
The toolbar icons are, from left to right:

* **Previous** - show the previous entry or today
* **Next** - show the next entry or today if next
* **Today** - show today's entry
* **Go to dateâ€¦** - show a date picker calendar to select a new date
* **Settings** - show the settings

Depending on the device and orientation, some items may be on the
menu.

## Swipe left and right
Swipe left and right in the diary will show the next or previous day
or in the custom calendar will show the next or previous month.

## Editing
In markdown mode the floating **Edit** button allows editing
entries. The **Accept** button restores the formatted view. You may cut
and paste this text into another page if you don't want it here.

You may store images in the diary storage folders and reference them
in diary entries so markdown text `![cat](cat.jpg)` will display `cat.jpg`
stored in the current month folder which is `Diary/<year>/<month>` on the
sdcard.

## Settings
* **Use custom calendar** - Use custom calendar that shows diary
  entries rather than date picker calendar
* **Use markdown** - Use markdown formatting for diary entries
* **About** - Show app version, licence and credits
